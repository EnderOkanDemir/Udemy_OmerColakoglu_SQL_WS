- This command helps us clear the table without deleting the table.
- To clear the table contents, we can use the following SQL query: TRUNCATE TABLE CUSTOMER
- And, the CUSTOMER table will still exist, and its column names will remain unchanged.
- When we add data to this table, the ID values will start from 1, unlike if we used the DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME command.

TRUNCATE TABLE CUSTOMER
