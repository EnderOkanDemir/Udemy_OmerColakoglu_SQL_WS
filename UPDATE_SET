ID, CUSTOMERNAME, CITY, DISTRICT, BIRTHDATE, GENDER, PHONE_NUMBER are the columns of CUSTOMER table

- Now, we will add an AGE column to our CUSTOMER table
- However, when we execute the SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER, there will be NULL in the AGE column
- Therefore, in order to populate these cells with ages, we will use UPDATE - SET commands like the following, utilizing DATEDIFF and GETDATE functions to calculate ages.


UPDATE CUSTOMER
SET AGE = DATEDIFF(YEAR,BIRTHDATE,GETDATE())


- DATEDIFF: Helps us calculate the date difference in terms of years, months, or days.
- GETDATE: Retrieves today's date.

UPDATE CUSTOMER
SET AGE = AGE + 1 


UPDATE CUSTOMER
SET AGE = AGE - 1
