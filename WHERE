SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (101, 102, 103);
- In this query, the "IN" operator is used to retrieve all rows from the "employees" table where the "department_id" column matches any of the values in the list (101, 102, 103). 
- This allows you to efficiently filter data based on multiple possible values for a column.
