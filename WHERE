SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (101, 102, 103);
- In this query, the "IN" operator is used to retrieve all rows from the "employees" table where the "department_id" column matches any of the values in the list (101, 102, 103). 
- This allows you to efficiently filter data based on multiple possible values for a column.

-- When we use the 'BETWEEN' clause in the query as follows, it will retrieve both the boundary values and the ages falling within these boundaries.
SELECT *

WHERE AGE BETWEEN 25 AND 27

-- We can retrieve the same result by using the AND command like the following but using BETWEEN is more comfortable in that kind of searching
-- We can achieve the same result by using the AND command as shown below, but using BETWEEN is more convenient for this type of search.
