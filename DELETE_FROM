- To clear the table contents, you can use the following SQL query: "DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME."
- However, the CUSTOMERCOPY table will still exist, and its column names will remain unchanged.
- When we add data to this table, the ID values will not start from 1, as they would if we used the TRUNCATE TABLE command. Instead, they will continue counting from where they last left off.

DELETE FROM CUSTOMERCOPY
